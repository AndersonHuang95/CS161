CS161 Homework 4 
Spring 2017 

The graph extacted from graph1.txt is unsatisfiable with 3 colors. 
However, the graph converted into a SAT Instance with 4 colors is solvable.

These results mean that there must be 4 or more colors to 
successfully color the graph. Another interesting fact is that 
this is also the maximum degree of any vertex in the graph. 

An example solution for graph1 is as follows: 

Let there be four colors: RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE. 

Color Node 1 RED.
Color Node 2 YELLOW.
Color Node 5 GREEN.
Color Node 6 BLUE.
Color Node 7 GREEN. 
Color Node 3 RED. 
Color Node 4 YELLOW. 

This is one solution. 

The graph extracted from graph2.txt is much more massive. It requires
8 more or colors to be a satisfiable instance.
